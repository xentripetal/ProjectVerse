## About

Project Verse is being designed as a fully moddable Unity game in
reference to Stardew Valley. All objects, events, worlds, cutscenes, and
scripted actions will be implemented using the API. 

The game itself will be taking place in the far future with heavy influences from the T.V. series Firefly.
The player will crash into a town similar to Stardew Valley and eventually gain enough wealth to fix his ship
and explore other worlds with different themes and quests all while promoting his budding enterprise of cargo
trading, production, and crime.


### Currently Implemented Features
* Movable Player
* Basic objects that can be scripted and have their data set via json.
* Storing and loading rooms from json files to allow editing/modability.
* Loading different rooms


### Planned Features
* Crop Growing - plantable crops that grow over a given lifecycle and produce a sellable item
* Home Building - Add objects into home, decorative and functional
* Modular Ship Design - Build/Purchase upgrades to ship that reflect in its physical design
* Quests - Players will given quests to complete.
* Relationships - Players will be able to build friendships and possibly more with NPCS (undecided on how explicit)
* Morality - Players will be given choices over time that will change a players morality score and affect the lives of NPCs.
* Managment - Players will be able to hire certain NPCS to do tasks for them, from handling crops, chopping trees, running cargo, or robbing ships.
* Automation - Players will slowly be able to add automation to their enterprise. I want them to be fully programmable, similar to Opencomputers minecraft mod. However I'm uncertain how feasible this will be.
* Trading - There will be an influenceable economy that will affect what and how the player trades items and moves cargo.
* A lot more - I am planning on updating this readme every other sprint (4 weeks) to add more information and put my thoughts and progress down.



## Development

Currently, the game is in stage INDEV. The expected stages are listed below.

Stage    | Description 
-------- | -------------
INDEV    | No contributions allowed, everything is variable to change. Goal is to have all basic mechanics plausible using the current API.
ALPHA    | No contributions allowed, some marketing will be done. basic story will be planned/implemented and custom art will become a priority. Advanced functionality will be added.
BETA     | Contributions allowed, game will be heavily marketed and sold. Forums/Website will be setup. API will be under heavy scrutiny and API feature requests will be heavily promoted. All art must be custom. Maybe networking/online?
OFFICIAL | API will be finalized, only bug fixes will be done to the API. More story will be added. Steam release with workshop support.

The development progress is currently tracked through hacknplan, however if this game picks up any popularity I will move
the progress tracker to a publicly accessible website. If you're reading this and want to see the progress, then it has
clearly reached enough popularity to merit it. So just put up an issue tracker in reference to this and ill go ahead and do it.


## Copyright & Licensing

The license is currently undecided. I intend to have some restrictions that would prevent this from being a truly FOSS game. 
However, until such a date, feel free to use whatever is here without restriction. Once a license is added, any changes made
to the resources above from that point on will no longer be without restriction but under the new license.

Note that most of the art assets are from [Hyptosis](https://opengameart.org/content/lots-of-free-2d-tiles-and-sprites-by-hyptosis) at OpenGameArt.org and thereby fall under CC BY 3.0. 


Additionally JSON.NET library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0.
