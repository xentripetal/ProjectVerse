  title: 2D Sample - Happy Harvest
  sections:
  - heading: About this project
    text: 'This 2D sample project, made by Unity, is a top-down farming simulation
      game that showcases how you can combine the suite of 2D tools and artwork to
      make your vision a reality. All of the content in the demo can be added into
      your own creative projects, and you can also extend the demo itself with your
      own systems, characters, collectables, and more.   We recommend that you read
      the articles that accompany Happy Harvest. Each article focuses on a key toolset
      used in the demo, providing further instructions so you can replicate the effects
      in your own projects. '

  - heading: 2D light and shadow techniques
    text: "Learn how to create and work with normal maps and mask maps (Secondary
      Textures). See how you can add rich details like mimicking the sun\u2019s movement
      throughout the day, using blob shadows to create shadows for any shape and
      time of day, and making infinite shadows with the Shadow Caster. You\u2019ll
      also pick up tips for optimizing your 2D lights."

  - heading: How to create art and gameplay with 2D tilemaps
    text: This page provides information on how the Tilemap System is used in the
      demo. Get more information about the Rule Tile feature, GameObject Brush, and
      how to use the Tilemap API for gameplay logic.

  - heading: How to animate 2D characters in Unity 2022 LTS
    text: This article covers how the 2D Animation and PSD Importer packages are
      used in the demo. Learn how to rig a character in the Sprite Editor and how
      to connect sprites to bones, geometry, and weights. Plus, see how you can use
      the Sprite Library Editor and Sprite Swap to create types of animations other
      than those that can be achieved with bone rotations, such as facial expressions
      when the character changes its facing direction.

  - heading: 2D special effects with the VFX Graph and Shader Graph
    text: Learn how to create the special effects in the demo with the Built-In Particle
      System, the VFX Graph, and Shader Graph. See how to create Flipbook particles
      using the VFX Graph and how to craft common effects like the water tiles, wind,
      fire, and smoke. Plus, learn how to create raindrops in the VFX Graph using
      the 2D Lit shader so they blend nicely with the environment, and how extra
      polishing was applied with postprocessing.
